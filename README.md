This repository demonstrates two unusual but potentially problematic errors in HTML.  The `bug.html` file showcases these errors, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code.  The errors are:

1. **Accessing a Non-Existent Element:** Attempting to manipulate an element before it's fully loaded into the DOM. 
2. **Incorrect Style Attribute Usage:** Incorrectly using the `style` attribute for adding styles.  Instead, class names with CSS rules are recommended for maintainability.

The solution focuses on proper DOM manipulation and improved styling practices.
